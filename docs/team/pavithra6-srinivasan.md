## Overview
CuddleCare is a CLI-based pet care tracker that allows users to track multiple pets, maintain detailed treatment 
histories, and quickly search and filter records.

My primary contribution was developing functionalities related to the treatment management system.

### Summary of Contributions

#### New Features
#### 1. Add Treatment Feature 

What it does: 
Allows users to add treatment records to a pet with treatment name, date, and optional notes.

Justification: 
This feature is essential for pet owners to maintain treatments records for each pet. The optional note field allows 
them to record important details such as doctor names, medications, or costs.

Highlights:
* Robust Input Validation:
  * Treatment names limited to 50 characters with regex pattern validation (`[a-zA-Z\\- ]+`)
  * Date validation ensures entries are within 10 years past to 100 years future (110-year window)
  * Empty optional parameter detection (prevents note/ with no value)
* Duplicate Prevention: Prevents adding identical treatment name and date for the same pet 
* Multi-line Note Support: Handles special characters and preserves formatting
* Integrated with `Ui` class for consistent error messaging

_PR_: [#23](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-T11-4/tp/pull/23)

#### 2. Delete Treatment Feature

What it does: 
Removes a treatment record from a pet's history by index.

Justification: 
Users need the ability to remove incorrect or unwanted treatment entries to maintain data accuracy.

Highlights:
* Uses 1-based indexing for user-friendliness 
* Includes comprehensive error handling for invalid indices and non-existent pets 
* Provides confirmation messages with the deleted treatment name

_PR_: [#31](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-T11-4/tp/pull/31)

#### 3. Find Treatments by Phrase Feature
   
What it does: 
Searches for treatments across all pets using case-insensitive substring matching.

Justification:  
Pet owners often need to quickly locate all instances of a particular treatment type (e.g., all vaccinations) across 
multiple pets.

Highlights:
* Displays results with pet names and dates for easy reference 
* Edge Case Handling:
  * Empty keyword validation 
  * No matches found messaging 
  * Handles pets with no treatments

_PR_: [#71](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-T11-4/tp/pull/71)

#### 4. Filter Treatments by Date Range Feature
   
What it does: 
Displays all treatments within a specified date range across all pets.

Justification: 
Essential for reviewing recent treatments, generating reports, or planning follow-up appointments.

Highlights:
* Inclusive date range (includes both start and end dates) matches user expectations 
* Validates that start date is not after end date 
* Provides clear error messages for invalid date formats or ranges

_PR_: [#74](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2113-T11-4/tp/pull/74)
